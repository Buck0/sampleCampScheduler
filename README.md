This application was made for CSCI 498 Senoir Project Construction. It is a people scheduler application for Camp La Vida.

* The application was built using Ruby on Rails.

* The app has a database of campers that are assigned to camp activities on a daily basis.

* Each camp activity can be turned off and on for each day before making the schedule.

* Once the schedule is made, campers can be reassigned if need be.

* Each camper will only be allowed to visit any activity once a week.

* This app is deployed using heroku at this URL: https://ancient-beach-67189.herokuapp.com/
