<h3 style="text-align: center">Curently in Development:</h3>
<h2>Major scheduler overhaul that should give better priority to camper preferences and hopefully reduce the amount of unassigned campers, this will change the app to ver. 2.0<hr />
 Backend cleanup that will reduce the overall size of the app (which is currently far over ten thousand lines), making load times a lot faster (theoretically)<hr />
 Flexible limits for activities to allow changing the max and min capacities for individual activities at will (this may be significant enough to change the app to ver. 3.0)<hr />
 Improvements to the scheduler for mini-camp weeks (the scheduler overhaul or flexible limits may eliminate the need for this)</h2>
